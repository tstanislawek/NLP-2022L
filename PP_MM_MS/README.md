# NLP_disco_polo_generator
Project for NLP course. The goal of the project is to build a model capable of generating lyrics for disco polo
songs. We were inspired by various examples of such work. We plan to
collect the data from Tekstowo.pl by scraping most popular Disco Polo bands. Then we
want to use pretrained language model by finetuning it on our dataset. In this way we
want to learn the model to generate Disco Polo. It this wonâ€™t be enough we plan to
enhance the process of generating songs. We expect many songs to be bad, so we want
to create a model capable of scoring how good the generated song is, and based on this
score present only songs with highest obtained score.
